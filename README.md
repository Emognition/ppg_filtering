A repository to filter the light intensity to BVP. 
It contains the results of carried out experiments.
Physiological signals were received from two types of devices (SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch and Empatica). 
The visualizations show the different types of filters used for the light intensity signal from the Samsung device and a comparison with the BVP signal from the Empatica device.
